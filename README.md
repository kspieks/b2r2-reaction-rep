# B2R2 Reaction Representation

This repo provides the means to:
- Generate the B2R2 reaction representations (in src/reaction_reps)
- Generate reaction representations from molecular representations (SLATM, FCHL, etc)
- Access 4 reaction datasets (SN2-20, GDB7-20-TS, Proparg-21-TS and Hydroform-22-TS)
- For the latter (Hydroform-22-TS), this is the only place to find the dataset 

An example generating learning curves for all reaction reps for the SN2 dataset is provided in Example SN2.ipynb 

This repo accompanies the paper "Physics-based representations for machine learning of chemical reactions"

# TODO 
- Usage for experimental data including conditions
